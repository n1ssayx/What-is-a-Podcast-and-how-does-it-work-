                    <h2>Definiton of Podcast</h2>
                </b>
            </summary>
            <p>A podcast is a program made available in digital format for download over the Internet.[1][2][3] For example, an episodic series of digital audio files that users can download to a personal device to listen to at a time of their choosing. Podcasts are primarily an audio medium, but some distribute video, either as their primary content or as a supplement to audio.[4]

            </p>
            <p>A podcast series usually features one or more recurring hosts engaged in a discussion about a particular topic or current event. Discussion and content within a podcast can range from carefully scripted to completely improvised. Podcasts combine elaborate and artistic sound production with thematic concerns ranging from scientific research to slice-of-life journalism. Many podcast series provide an associated website with links and show notes, guest biographies, transcripts, additional resources, commentary, and occasionally a community forum dedicated to discussing the show's content.
    
            </p>
            <p>The cost to the consumer is low, and many podcasts are free to download. Some podcasts are underwritten by corporations or sponsored, with the inclusion of commercial advertisements. In other cases, a podcast could be a business venture supported by some combination of a paid subscription model, advertising or product delivered after sale. Because podcast content is often free, podcasting is often classified as a disruptive medium, adverse to the maintenance of traditional revenue models.
    
            </p>
            <p>Podcasting is the preparation and distribution of audio files using RSS feeds to the devices of subscribed users. A podcaster normally buys this service from a podcast hosting company such as SoundCloud or Libsyn. Hosting companies then distribute these audio files to streaming services, such as Apple and Spotify, which users can listen to on their smartphones or digital music and multimedia players.
    
            </p>
            <p>As of December 2022, there are at least 2,999,008 podcasts and 152,596,784 episodes.[5]

                <h2>Etymology</h2>
            </summary>
            <p>"Podcast" is a portmanteau of "iPod" and "broadcast".[6][7][8] The earliest use of "podcasting" was traced to The Guardian columnist and BBC journalist Ben Hammersley,[9] who coined it in early February 2004 while writing an article for The Guardian newspaper.[10] The term was first used in the audioblogging community in September 2004, when Danny Gregoire introduced it in a message to the iPodder-dev mailing list,[11][12] from where it was adopted by podcaster Adam Curry.[13] Despite the etymology, the content can be accessed using any computer or similar device that can play media files.[citation needed] The term "podcast" predates Apple's addition of podcasting features to the iPod and the iTunes software.[14]

                </b>
            </summary>
            <p>In September 2000,[15] early MP3 player manufacturer i2Go offered a service called MyAudio2Go.com which allowed users to download news stories for listening on a PC or MP3 player. The service was available for about a year until i2Go's demise in 2001.[16]

            </p>
            <p>In October 2000, the concept of attaching sound and video files in RSS feeds was proposed in a draft by Tristan Louis.[17] The idea was implemented by Dave Winer, a software developer and an author of the RSS format.[18]

            </p>
            <p>Podcasting, once an obscure method of spreading audio information, has become a recognized medium for distributing audio content, whether for corporate or personal use. Podcasts are similar to radio programs in form, but they exist as audio files that can be played at a listener's convenience, anytime and anywhere.[19]

            </p>
            <p>The first application to make this process feasible was iPodderX, developed by August Trometer and Ray Slakinski.[20] By 2007, audio podcasts were doing what was historically accomplished via radio broadcasts, which had been the source of radio talk shows and news programs since the 1930s. This shift occurred as a result of the evolution of internet capabilities along with increased consumer access to cheaper hardware and software for audio recording and editing.[19]

            </p>
            <p>In August 2004, Adam Curry launched his show Daily Source Code. It was a show focused on chronicling his everyday life, delivering news, and discussions about the development of podcasting, as well as promoting new and emerging podcasts. Curry published it in an attempt to gain traction in the development of what would come to be known as podcasting and as a means of testing the software outside of a lab setting. The name Daily Source Code was chosen in the hope that it would attract an audience with an interest in technology.[21][22] Daily Source Code started at a grassroots level of production and was initially directed at podcast developers. As its audience became interested in the format, these developers were inspired to create and produce their own projects and, as a result, they improved the code used to create podcasts. As more people learned how easy it was to produce podcasts, a community of pioneer podcasters quickly appeared.[23]

            </p>
            <p>In June 2005, Apple released iTunes 4.9, which added formal support for podcasts, thus negating the need to use a separate program in order to download and transfer them to a mobile device. Although this made access to podcasts more convenient and widespread, it also effectively ended advancement of podcatchers by independent developers. Additionally, Apple issued cease and desist orders to many podcast application developers and service providers for using the term "iPod" or "Pod" in their products' names.[24]

            </p>
            <p>As of early 2019, the podcasting industry still generated little overall revenue,[25] although the number of persons who listen to podcasts continues to grow steadily. Edison Research, which issues the Podcast Consumer quarterly tracking report estimated that 90 million persons in the U.S. had listened to a podcast in January 2019.[26] As of 2020, 58% of the population of South Korea and 40% of the Spanish population had listened to a podcast in the last month. 12.5% of the UK population had listened to a podcast in the last week and 22% of the United States population listens to at least one podcast weekly.[27] The form is also acclaimed for its low overhead for a creator to start and maintain their show, merely requiring a microphone, a computer or mobile device, and associated software to edit and upload the final product. Some form of acoustic quieting is also often utilised. Podcast creators tend to have a good listener base because of their relationships with the listeners.[28]

            <h3>Software</h3>
            <p>Podcast episodes are widely stored and encoded in the mp3 digital audio format and then hosted on dedicated or shared webserver space.[79][80] Syndication of podcasts' episodes across various websites and platforms is based on RSS feeds, an XML-formatted file citing information about the episode and the podcast itself.[79]

            </p>
            <h3>Hardware</h3>
            <p>The most basic equipment for a podcast is a computer and a microphone. It is helpful to have a sound-proof room and headphones. The computer should have a recording or streaming application installed.[81] Typical microphones for podcasting are connected using USB.[82][83] If the podcast involves two or more people, each person requires a microphone, and a USB audio interface is needed to mix them together. If the podcast includes video (livestreaming), then a separate webcam might be needed, and additional lighting.[82]
